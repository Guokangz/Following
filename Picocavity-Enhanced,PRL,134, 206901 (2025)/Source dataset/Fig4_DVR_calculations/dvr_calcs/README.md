# Supporting Material for DVR calculations

Scripts for reproducing the numerical data in Tables S1-S3, used for plotting panels (b)-(e) for Fig. 4

 * If necessary, set up a virtual environment, then install the necessary modules with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` 

 * `source env.sh` to update $PATH and $PYTHONPATH

 * `cd calcs/` 

 * `./run1d.sh` to generate data from the 1D vibrationally adiabatic model

 * `./run2d.sh` to generate data for the 2D model (this takes a couple of minutes)
